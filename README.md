# taskunifier-geoff

A fork of TaskUnifier, originally by Benjamin Leclerc.

TaskUnifier is a powerful and customizable to-do
list management software that runs on desktop machines.

Currently this fork does not build, and is not
affiliated with the original author.

This code is mostly here for curiosity's sake, but
may someday be modified to work properly.

The original author's version can be downloaded at:
